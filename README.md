 Ansible Thinkpad Setup
==========================
My old Ansible Playbook for my Lenovo Thinkpad.

 What is this playbook good for:
--------------------------------
 + Install common usefull base packages
 + Create dotfiles like .bashrc and .vimrc
 + Setup and configure I3WM as Window Manager

 WARNING:
-----------------------
This playbook collection is a little bit outdated.
Please have a look into [GitHub.com/DO1JLR/ansible_thinkpad_setup](https://github.com/DO1JLR/ansible_thinkpad_setup.git) for a more modern ansible playbook collection for different devices and use cases *(office, home, tower...)*

Thank you
